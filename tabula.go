Package tabula is a Go library for working with rows, columns, or matrix
(table), or in another terms working with data set.

# Overview

Go's slice gave a flexible way to manage sequence of data in one type, but what
if you want to manage a sequence of value but with different type of data?
Or manage a bunch of values like a table?

You can use this library to manage sequence of value with different type
and manage data in two dimensional tuple.

## Terminology

Here are some terminologies that we used in developing this library, which may
help reader understand the internal and API.

Record is a single cell in row or column, or the smallest building block of
dataset.

Row is a horizontal representation of records in dataset.

Column is a vertical representation of records in dataset.
Each column has a unique name and has the same type data.

Dataset is a collection of rows and columns.

Given those definitions we can draw the representation of rows, columns, or
matrix:

	        COL-0  COL-1 ...  COL-x
	ROW-0: record record ... record
	ROW-1: record record ... record
	...
	ROW-y: record record ... record

## Record Type

There are only three valid type in record: int64, float64, and string.

## Dataset Mode

Tabula has three mode for dataset: rows, columns, or matrix.

For example, given a table of data,

    col1,col2,col3
    a,b,c
    1,2,3

"rows" mode is where each line saved in its own slice, resulting in Rows:

    Rows[0]: [a b c]
    Rows[1]: [1 2 3]

"columns" mode is where each line saved by columns, resulting in Columns:

    Columns[0]: {col1 0 0 [] [a 1]}
    Columns[1]: {col2 0 0 [] [b 2]}
    Columns[1]: {col3 0 0 [] [c 3]}

Unlike rows mode, each column contain metadata including column name, type,
flag, and value space (all possible value that _may_ contain in column value).

"matrix" mode is where each record saved both in row and column.

Matrix mode consume more memory but give a flexible way to manage records.
